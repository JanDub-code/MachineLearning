# MachineLearning

Primary work lives in [FOREX/](FOREX/) and focuses on a multi‑pair, high‑vol momentum edge with strict walk‑forward validation and portfolio monitoring.

Key areas:
- Multi‑pair backtests and portfolio aggregation
- Monitoring (rolling expectancy, PF, drawdown, trade frequency)
- Dukascopy data pipeline

See [FOREX/README.md](FOREX/README.md) for current workflow.
